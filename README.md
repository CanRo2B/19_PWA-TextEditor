## Utilize the Challenge
To run this program you can do one of two things, you can go to the heroku app, ( https://arcane-mesa-59397.herokuapp.com/), you can open up the integrated terminal.  Run build the project.  Then npm run start to open the application on local host 3000.  You can open this on an open browser.  It will prompt you to install in which a new application is applied to your computer.  I opened up chrome apps and opened J.A.T.E.  From this moment, you can enter in text and it is stored in your local indexdb in the application area of the webpage.

A huge thank you to the Veronica the Amazing TA and the other instructional staff, John and Don, in our UCF Bootcamp class. I relied heavily on our start-up video in which she described and gave us input as to what to do.
